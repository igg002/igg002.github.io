My dream is to be a leader who makes the world a happy and exciting place where everyone gets inspired by innovative games and virtual worlds.

Games themselves are enjoyable, but they can do more than entertainâ€”they can act as a medium for changing the world. By playing games, players get inspiration and motivation, which they apply to the real world. Fictional characters become role models, players develop creative problem-solving skills, and learn life lessons by passionately trying to become heroes of a larger world. Many scientists at NASA, who expand the boundaries of human exploration, say that sci-fi games and movies inspired their start in the field. There are lots of people throughout the world pushing human boundaries forward. The grand stories that interactive media provide drive them. I believe that games, the most interactive form of entertainment, have the power to increase human and social potential and to push the world forward.
