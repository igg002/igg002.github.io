#### Description

Swingby is a space simulation game in which the player gets to control a space probe. The game eliminates the slow-paced gameplay of simulation games and encourages players to act strategically and flexibly.

The player has to avoid asteroids using minimal fuel and reach the swing-by trajectory. Swing-by success depends on timing and speed. If the player enters the orbit of a planet in high velocity, the probe collides with the planet.

The difficulty gradually increases as the player progresses towards the endpoint. The number of planets without fueling stations and the frequency of appearance of asteroids increases. When the probe docks with the fueling station, it fills a certain amount of fuel, and the amount of filling decreases over time. To meet the increasing difficulty, the player has to play with careful use of fuel.

#### Awards

Swingby won the **Grand Prize (1st Place) in the 7th Annual Sogang University MTEC National High School Game Competition**.
