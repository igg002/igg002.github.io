# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:. I'm a game developer and a machine learning engineer, specializing in AI for games and generative systems.

* :office: I currently work at [LoadComplete](https://www.loadcomplete.com/) as a prototype developer focusing on ways to integrate machine learning into the studio's game development process.

* :school: I'm currently taking a leave of absence from [RPI](https://rpi.edu/), where I'm pursuing an undergraduate degree in digital entertainment innovation, design, and technology.

* :video_game: I also love doing indie game development in my spare time!
