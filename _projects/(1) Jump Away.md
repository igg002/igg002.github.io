##### Role: Co-Director, Game Designer / Programmer
##### Genre: Action

Jump Away is a racing game in which two players compete against each other. The two players can attack and push each other away from collecting coins or reaching the endpoint. When a player reaches the end point, the person with more coin wins. On the other hand, if no one gets to the end point and a player out of the play zone in the middle, the player loses.

Because the game has several obstacles on the stage and can be played in two different ways, it induces the player to recognize one's situation and play strategically.
