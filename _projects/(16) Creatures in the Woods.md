<!-- General Description -->
You are a hunter and after many days out on the field nightfall comes once again and you find yourself surrounded by what could be the dangers of the wild. As you fend off the creatures you find a cabin in the woods which you decide to enter, but with your strength drained you collapse from exhaustion. Once you wake up, you go outside and find yourself surrounded by an environment with a entirely different tone, everything seems bright and the animals seem non-hostile. As you explore the land you recruit the animals that once seemed deadly to help you explore the surrounding land and solve puzzles. As you bond with these creatures you find that there really was no reason to hunt them down. I guess you just needed to open up your eyes to see the beauty of the things that surround you.

Inpired by the puzzle stages in *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, I programmed a simple mesh-deformation mechanic and used it to design physics-based puzzle stages.
