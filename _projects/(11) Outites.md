#### Background
Since I was a child, my dream was to travel the universe and to boldly go where no one has gone before. Planets full of wonder, mysterious alien creatures, and breathtaking civilizations. I wanted to express these beautiful and charming experience of exploration as a game.

#### Designing the Game
The design goal of the project was to make a game that is different from typical mobile games and make it as innovative and experimental as we can. Usual mobile games are small in scale (compared to PC games), consist of repetitive gameplay, and quantitates success using scores. I wanted to break these general rules of mobile games.

#### What is Outites?
Outites is a game where the player becomes the explorer, discovers unknown planets, and transforms the planet using resources.
<br>

#### Procedurally Generated Planets
We wanted the player to have a new experience every time they discovered a new planet. The planet generation system in Outites can create billions of unique planets. Each world has a different combination of resource reserves, topography, colors in the environment, and the placement of natural elements.

#### Collecting Resources
In the process of mining (deforming the planet), the player can obtain underground mineral resources such as stones, gold, copper, and iron. The mining probabilities are unique to each world.

Players can also construct buildings. Each building generates resources at a certain time. The interval of resource generation time is determined by the fertility of the planet and the degree of wind blowing.
