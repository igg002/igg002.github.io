#### Description
Corrupt Circuits is a fast paced one-touch game where you attempt to slow down the eventual corruption of your computer by going through a series of arcade-like touch based challenges. You attempt to delay the computer from destroying all of its files and data by playing four simple minigames to “rescue” the files.
