<!-- Abstract / About -->
#### About

Built for Google's Tango platform, Tango brush is an AR app that provides painting tools for the user to draw 3D paintings in both virtual spaces (VR mode) and in real space (AR mode). This app was built during the TrendX VR/AR hackathon that took place in 2016.

<!-- Technical Features & Challenges & Highlights -->
#### Supporting Both AR and VR Mode

At the time I was developing this application, most of the popular VR painting applications, such as Tilt Brush, only allowed the player to draw in virtual space. Because of that, our team thought that it would be interesting to make a VR application that allows the player to draw in real space. Google's Tango tablet, which had the most accurate device tracking functionality at the time, also had the functionality to reconstruct the surrounding environment in 3D using multiple different cameras embedded within the device. Using this function of the tango tablet, our team developed a mode that allows the player to reconstruct their surrounding environment and create 3D paintings in that reconstructed space.

#### Audio-Reactive Brush

In addition to normal brushes, Tango Brush also has audio-reactive brushes, allowing the player to give interesting variations to their drawings.
