**Background**

In honor of the 170th anniversary of Harriet Tubman’s escape from slavery, our team designed an educational board game that got displayed at the Harriet Tubman anniversary exhibition.

**Description**

Safehouse is a 2-player competitive board game where people take on diluted roles regarding serious topics of slavery. One player takes the role of a station master, helping slaves hide in the safe house as they attempt to not be caught. The other player takes the role of a slave hunter, searching for runaway slaves to take back south, with the goal of discovering the hiding spots.

**Embedded Values**

The embedded values of Safehouse include protection, risk, loss, and relief. Although Safehouse is a game that can be taken at any pace, each turn can be strenuous. Whether it's nearing the turn limit as the Slave Hunter or trying not to react as the Station Master when the Slave Hunter is in the possession of a board containing the hiding spot, the game allows for plenty of relief, distress and suspense thereout. Additionally, Safehouse’s balanced mechanics allow for the game to be played at a competitive level which calls for a level of strategy and competition to be done successfully.

Also, the capturing of historical figures gives the slave hunter something that makes them consider their moral standpoint as the slave hunter. And the debriefing session allows the players to carefully review and imagine the consequences that could have happened if the result of the game happened in real life. These two combined make the game experience embed the values of more deep and serious thought and education.

**Design Goals**

The main topic we selected for designing the game was the “Shifting game board.” With that topic in mind, we started the initial ideation process of choosing the target essential experiences and the core rules and mechanics of our game. The essential experiences we chose for this game were: strategy, relief, distress, anxiety, danger, and suspense. And with those two design constraints, we envisioned a game about a station master and a slave hunter competing in a house with movable furnitures, where the station master places hiding spots and rearranges them to strategically confuse the slave hunter, while the slave hunter moves and checks.
