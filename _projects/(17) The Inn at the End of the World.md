<!-- General Description -->
#### A Quiet Apocalypse
Inspired by games such as The Stillness of the Wind and Ori and the Blind Forest, the setting of The Inn at the End of the World is after the end of human civilization (as we know it), but there aren’t zombies, aliens, or bloodthirsty raiders. Things are just quiet and empty where the player is, as the ruins of humanity’s zenith slowly rust. 

<br>

#### Character Caring
In a desolate space, the goal of the main character is to find human connection. The characters in this game should thus be deeply developed and enticing to interact with for players.

<br>

#### Rebuilding instead of Destroying
The other main goal of the player is building up their inn, allowing it to host more guests. In addition, they need to find better meals for guests and unique materials to allow navigation through the world. 

<br>

#### What is the game? 
This game is a combination of visual novel and life-simulator, in the vein of Harvest Moon. Playing it is alternately relaxing and intriguing as the character’s stories unfold while the player goes about their business in a strange world. 

The main focus is building up the inn, meeting new characters, and learning about those characters’ stories in order to build up the inn’s reputation. A key part of this is cooking, as each character has specific tastes in food. Fulfilling these tastes nets the best material and reputational rewards.

This game has a stronger emphasis on peacefulness than most post-apocalyptic games. In addition, the main mechanics are intended to promote a slow, relaxing play experience, sort of like a more desolate Stardew Valley.
