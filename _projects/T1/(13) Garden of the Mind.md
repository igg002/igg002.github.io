<!-- Abstract / About -->
#### About

Garden of the Mind is an experimental PC game where the player colorfully paints the monotonous game world by planting unique procedurally generated trees and exploring the possibility space of the game. The game is an open-ended sandbox simulation game. The player is free to set their own goals and play as they want to play.

The core feature I wanted to explore through this project was procedurally generating trees. Inspired by existing 2D tree generation projects, I implemented a modified L-system generator with custom rules that support generating not only 2D but also 3D tree structures.
