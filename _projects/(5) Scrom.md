#### Background

While watching the tv series "Silicon Valley," I saw a startup company using the scrum task board. I usually do a lot of projects, and I thought it would be very efficient to do things the way they handled their plans, and it turned out to be very useful. I thought that it would be a good idea to make this scrum task board available to many people online.

#### What is Scrom?

Scrom is an online website that provides users with a scrum task board service. The user can add a task by assigning its title, deadline, and detailed information. After adding tasks, the user can designate the tasks to stages by its progress: to-do, working, done. By using this service, individuals or groups can efficiently manage their work tasks on projects.
