### Background
Recently, AI systems using deep learning has been creating new generative art pieces that we've never seen before. I was deeply impressed by AI doing art, so I decided to develop such a system for inspiration for my games.

#### 1. Handwritten Character Generation
Using a simple GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), the model was able to generate realistic-looking handwritten number character images.

#### 2. TV Script Generation
The next step was to create actual texts. I used an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to train scripts from The Simpsons. Given starting words, the network predicts the most likely word to come after, and iterating through the process several times, the network generates text.

At first glance, the script looks real. But it actually is quite nonsense.

#### 3. Face Generation
The last thing I tried to do was to generate faces!

As I did when making a model to generate handwritten character images, I used a convolutional GAN model.

Surprisingly, the model was able to generate a large amount of complex but diverse faces.

### Conclusion
가장 기본적인 생성 모델들인 GAN과 RNN을 사용해서 사진과 텍스트를 생성해내는 것에 성공했다. 생성된 작품의 퀄리티는 완벽하다고 할 수 없지만, 상당히 믿을만한 작품을 만들어내서 굉장히 놀랐다.

나는 창의성이 새로운 것, 그리고 다양한 것을 경험함으로써 발달한다고 생각한다. 때문에, 이런 generative model들이 게임을 개발할 때 게임 캐릭터를 생성해낸다거나, 그런 예술 작품을 만들어낼 때 out-of-the-box 사고를 촉진시킬 잠재력을 많이 가지고있다고 생각하게 되었다.

I succeeded in generating pictures and texts using the most basic generation models, GAN and RNN. I can not say that the quality of the created works is perfect, but I was very surprised to have produced quite credible works.

I think that creativity develops by experiencing new things and various things. So, I think that these generative models have a lot of potential to create game characters when developing games, or to promote out-of-the-box thinking when creating such works of art.

I succeeded in creating pictures and text using the most basic model of creation, GAN and RNN. The quality of the work produced was not perfect, but I was very surprised to have produced a fairly reliable piece.

I think creativity develops by experiencing new things and different things. Therefore, it occurred to me that these generic models have a lot of potential to create game characters when developing games or to promote out-of-the-box thinking when creating such works of art.

I think that creativity develops with various new experiences. So, I think that these generative models have a lot of potential to promote out-of-the-box thinking when creating art.
