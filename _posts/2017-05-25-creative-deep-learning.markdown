### Background
Recently, AI systems using deep learning has been creating new generative art pieces that we've never seen before. I was deeply impressed by AI doing art, so I decided to develop such a system for inspiration for my games.

#### 1. Handwritten Character Generation
Using a simple GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), the model was able to generate realistic-looking handwritten number character images.

#### 2. TV Script Generation
The next step was to create actual texts. I used an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to train scripts from The Simpsons. Given starting words, the network predicts the most likely word to come after, and iterating through the process several times, the network generates text.

At first glance, the script looks real. But it actually is quite nonsense.

#### 3. Face Generation
The last thing I tried to do was to generate faces!

As I did when making a model to generate handwritten character images, I used a convolutional GAN model.

</center>

Surprisingly, the model was able to generate a large amount of complex but diverse faces.

### Conclusion
I succeeded in generating pictures and texts using the most basic generation models, GAN and RNN. I can not say that the quality of the created works is perfect, but I was shocked that the systems produced fairly realistic-looking works.

I think that creativity develops with various new experiences. So, I think that these generative models have a lot of potential to promote out-of-the-box thinking when creating art.
