### Background

I'm a big fan of Star Trek, a famous Sci-fi TV series. Watching the spaceship Enterprise traveling through space, I dreamed of myself being the captain, commanding the spaceship myself. I wanted to make this fantasy into a game and also wanted to differentiate it from the gameplay that was often tried. So our team tried to make an experimental game using machine learning.

Captain on the Bridge is a game in which the player becomes the captain of the ship. The goal is to survive the attack of  enemy ships. The weapon system of the enemy ship is controlled by an AI trained on the data played by human. The player must play the game with strategic moves and judgments.

#### AI System with Deep Learning
Instead of using a rule-based AI system, The weapon targeting system of the enemy ship is controlled by a trained AI based on the data played by the developer.

#### Fully Physics-Based Enemy Guidance System
Until now, I have been developing pathfinding AI only in games with surfaces, so we had to make a totally new navigating AI because the game has no such surface. The navigation system predicts the ship's future position, and based on the prediction, the system calculates the amount of propulsion needed to maintain a good position to fight with the enemy.
