Role: Director, Programmer

### Background

While watching the drama "Silicon Valley," I saw a startup company in this drama use the scrum task board. I usually do a lot of projects, and I thought it would be very efficient to do things that way, and it was actually very effective. I thought that it would be a good idea to make this scrum task board available to many people online.

### What is Scrom?

Scrom is an online website that provides users with a scrum task board service. The user can add a task by assigning its title, deadline, and detailed information. After adding tasks, the user can assign the tasks to stages by its progress: to-do, working, done. By using this service, individuals or groups can efficiently work on projects.
