### Background

Global warming is one of the biggest problems that humankind is facing today. Since the mid-20th century, the increase in CO2 emissions has caused problems such as sea level rise and desertification on Earth. Our team developed this game to inform the environmental damage caused by the indiscreet use of fossil fuel.

Energy Master is a strategy game in which the player builds power stations to increase the score. The player must increase the population to increase the score while producing sufficient energy proportional to the population. Players must balance the construction of environmentally friendly but less energy-efficient energy power stations with energy-efficient non-renewable energy power stations that destroy the environment. The higher the percentage of renewable energy power stations in the total construction, the higher the score, and vice versa.

#### Procedurally Generated Environment
Instead of handcrafting a single stage, we developed a procedural generation system to prevent repetitive gameplay. The system creates the game stage using a custom cellular automata model. And to determine the wind velocity, solar radiation, and reserve value of each tile, we used 2D perlin noise for natural distribution.

With Energy Master, our team won the **Gold Prize (1st Place) in the 3rd School (Sunrin Internet High School) Hackathon Game Application Field and the President Award (1st Place) in the 8th Sogang University MTEC National High School Student Game Application Competition**.
