# Machine Learning Engineer @ [LoadComplete](https://www.loadcomplete.com/)

Full-time; 2022/07 - Present

<!-- Work, Responsibilities, and Activities -->
Machine learning engineer on the Applied ML team, focusing on building and integrating machine learning solutions into the studio's game development and servicing processes.

- Led the design and development of the machine learning-based automated playtesting process for *Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium* and an upcoming title, which greatly contributed to bug discovery and design validation. This involved devising and implementing all of the system components behind this process and the modelâ€™s architecture.
- Designed and implemented the internal solution for building and deploying deep learning-trained game-playing agents in Unity. This solution addressed the limitations of the previous solution by featuring improved speed, scalability, and extensibility through features such as async action retrieval, dynamic batching, a plugin-based architecture, and more robust fault tolerance.
- Led the design and development of predictive modeling systems to support the servicing of our games and established stable, cloud-native MLOps for developing, servicing, and monitoring these models.
- Implemented advanced training algorithms and techniques for optimized and more effective model training.

## GDC 2024

I presented the work on the automated playtesting process for *Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium* at GDC 2024 in a talk titled ["Testing Empowered: Integrating ML-Based Playtesting in a Team with Limited QA Capacity"](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/testing-empowered-integrating-ml-based-playtesting-in-a-team-with-limited-qa-capacity/898710). Recording of the talk can be found [here](https://gdcvault.com/play/1034179/Testing-Empowered-Integrating-ML-Based).
