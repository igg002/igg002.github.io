# Machine Learning Engineer @ [LoadComplete](https://www.loadcomplete.com/)

Full-time; 2022/07 - Present

<!-- Work, Responsibilities, and Activities -->
Currently working at LoadComplete’s Applied ML team as a machine learning engineer, focusing on building and integrating machine-learning-based solutions into the studio’s game development processes.

- Led the design and development of the machine learning-based automated playtesting process for [*Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium*](https://game.dosi.world/promotion/fagirl), which greatly contributed to bug discovery and design validation. This involved devising and implementing all of the system components behind this process and the model’s architecture.
- Designed and implemented the internal solution for building and deploying deep learning-trained game-playing agents in Unity. This solution addressed the limitations of the previous solution by featuring improved speed, scalability, and extensibility through features such as async action retrieval, dynamic batching, a plugin-based architecture, and more robust fault tolerance.
- Implemented advanced training algorithms and techniques for optimized and more effective model training.
- Currently developing ML-based automated playtesting for an upcoming title, and actively experimenting with ideas related to player modeling and game personalization to improve user experience and create business value.

## GDC 2024

I presented the work on the automated playtesting process for *Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium* at GDC 2024 in a talk titled ["Testing Empowered: Integrating ML-Based Playtesting in a Team with Limited QA Capacity"](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/testing-empowered-integrating-ml-based-playtesting-in-a-team-with-limited-qa-capacity/898710). Recording of the talk can be found [here](https://gdcvault.com/play/1034179/Testing-Empowered-Integrating-ML-Based).
