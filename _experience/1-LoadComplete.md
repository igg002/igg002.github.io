# Machine Learning Engineer @ [LoadComplete](https://www.loadcomplete.com/)

Full-time; 2022/07 - Present

<!-- Work, Responsibilities, and Activities -->
Currently working at LoadComplete's Applied ML team as a machine learning engineer. My focus lies in building and integrating machine-learning-based solutions into the studioâ€™s game development process.
- Led the design and development of the machine-learning-powered automated playtesting process for [*Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium*](https://game.dosi.world/promotion/fagirl). This involved devising and implementing all of the system components behind this process and also the model's architecture.
- Designed and implemented the internal solution for building and deploying deep-learning-trained game-playing agents in Unity. This solution was built to address the limitations of the previous solution, featuring improved speed and scalability, better extensibility through a plugin-based architecture, and stronger fault-tolerance measures.
- Currently implementing ML-based automated playtesting for an upcoming title, and actively experimenting with ideas related to player modeling and game personalization for better user experience and business value creation.

## GDC 2024

I presented the work on the automated playtesting process for *Frame Arms Girl: Dream Stadium* at GDC 2024 in a talk titled ["Testing Empowered: Integrating ML-Based Playtesting in a Team with Limited QA Capacity"](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/testing-empowered-integrating-ml-based-playtesting-in-a-team-with-limited-qa-capacity/898710).
